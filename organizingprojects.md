#Github + Project Organization

Project-oriented vs. task-oriented developers
- Task-oriented = put me to work with the list of work you want me to do; just feed me stuff to work on
- project-oriented = what's the bigger idea, what does "success" look like?

Front-loading the project management structure vs. figuring it out along the way and tracking issues

Developers often don't know what category they are?

OVPR says that industry folks are happy with the skillsets that students come out with, but that they don't have the big picture

Socialized to think in binaries (works/doesn't work, right/wrong) and that affects how they start working (and think about that job)

Is Digital Studies giving a more holistic viewpoint for this kind of work? 

Managers don't appreciate the nuances of communication 
- navigating the questions down the road

Email is a bad method to communicate (black hole)
- Any meaningful project communication should have a URL for it
- Hard to go back over earlier email threads, also cross-talk
- lowering the barriers between having the conversation and documenting it

Much more evident in a Github project of the conversation element than a Wiki
